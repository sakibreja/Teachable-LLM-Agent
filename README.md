# Teachable-LLM-Agent
🚀 Introducing my latest AI experiment: Teachable LLM Agent 💡

Imagine an AI that not only answers your questions — but learns from you over time.
With AutoGen, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Teachability, I built a system that grows smarter with every conversation.

🛠 Key Components:

GPT-4o (OpenAI API)

AutoGen Agents (ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent)

Teachability Memory

Secure environment with python-dotenv

🔁 Agent Workflow: Configure ➤ Teach ➤ Interact ➤ Learn
📌 Visual workflow and credits in the diagram below!

Proudly built by MD SAKIB REJA 👨‍💻
Open to collaboration, feedback, or ideas!
